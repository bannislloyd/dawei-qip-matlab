A. Get the data of the experimental spectrum

1. Upload the experimenal data to the folder 'results'.
2. Open 'exp_twqubit.m' and change the path 
   specstruc = getspec('/home/dtrottie/NMR/EXPERIMENTS/twqubit/results/505',4);
   For example, 505 is the EXPNO and 4 is the PRONO.
3. Run 'exp_twqubit.m' and the data will be saved in exp.mat.
4. Copy the exp.mat to your computer.

B. Get the data of the simulated spectrum
1. Open 'sample.m' and change the initial state. In usual case, it is the thermal equilibrium state.
2. Open 'spectro.m' and change the necessary parameters. Note: swh and o1 shoule be set the same as the experimental spectrum. It will be convinient to make comparisions.
3. Write the pulse program in '/pulseprog/compiled/name'(For example, '7coh' here).
4. Run 'sim_twqubit.m' and the data will be saved in sim.mat.
5. Copy the sim.mat to your computer.
