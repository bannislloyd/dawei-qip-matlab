1. Usually if you use both C and H channels, set the H channel as the 1st one and C channel 2nd one.

2. The frequencies (chemical shifts) of all spins require "minus" signs before the normal (you observed on the spectrometer) values! Assuming  
the chemical shift of C1 is 20000Hz, in molecule.def please write it as -20000.

3. All the J-couplings should be divided by 2! If J = 100Hz, please write it as 50 in this file.

I dont know why the definitions of the Hamiltonian are like this...
