<1> Modify molecule.def
1. The frequencies (chemical shifts) of all spins require "minus" signs before the normal (you observed on the spectrometer) values! Assuming  
the chemical shift of C1 is 20000Hz, in molecule.def please write it as -20000.
2. refFreq	C means the transmit frequency (O1). Also defined as the "minus" value of the real O1. You can write it as "C1;C2;C3", which means O1
is now the average fidelity of these 3 chemical shifts.
3. All the J-couplings should be divided by 2! If J = 100Hz, please write it as 50 in this file.

<2> Modify sample.m
1. Define the subsystem of spins. If you have 3 spins activated, write like this 
"spins_sub{1} = [1]; 
  spins_sub{2} = [2]; 
  spins_sub{3} = [3];"
